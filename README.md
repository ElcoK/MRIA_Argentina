# MRIA Argentina
This repository holds the code to perform a multiregional impact assessment for Argentina.

## Python requirements
Recommended option is to use a [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
environment to work in for this project, relying on conda to handle some of the
trickier library dependencies.

```bash
# Add conda-forge channel for extra packages
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# Create a conda environment for the project and install packages
conda env create -f .environment.yml
```

## How to run the model from a notebook

Move to the project folder (**Argentina_MRIA**), activate the virtual environment and jupyter lab:

```bash
(base) conda activate MRIA_ARG
(MRIA_ARG) jupyter lab
```
